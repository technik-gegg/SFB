# SFB

Firmware code for the  Smart Filament Buffer as published on [Thingiverse][1].

This filament buffer comes with an integrated filament run-out detector, which is based on the Arduino Nano and a bunch of linear Hall-Effect sensors.
An integrated OLED display makes reading the current status and configuration a breeze.

The schematics for this project are pretty straight forward:
![Schematic](https://github.com/technik-gegg/SFB/tree/master/Schematics/SFB/Schematic.jpg)

All the electronic parts will fit on a standard 60 x 40 mm prototype board.
There are 3 microswitches used to handle the integrated menus. J1 gets connected to your 3D printer and will take a 5V and GND power input on pins 1 and 2, pin 3 will be set to HIGH as soon as a run-out has been detected. Configured correctly, this signal will cause your 3D Printer to pause the print before it runs out of filament.

On a Duet3D controller board you'll need these two lines of GCode in your config.g:

~~~

M591 D0 P2 C2 S1        ; Set filament sensing sensor to switch (active high)
M581 E0 T1 S1 C1        ; Configure external trigger to pause the print only when printing
~~~

# Run-out detection

The run-out detection does not need to know which filament is currently in use. It will monitor all sensors continously and as soon as all of them are within the threshold (+-50 Gauss by default), it'll start a timeout countdown (default 60 seconds) after which the run-out signal will be set.
If one of the sensors gets triggered while the counter is active, the counter will be interrupted and reset. This behaviour is needed for retractions and/or tool changes.
Via the integrated menu, you'll be able to configure the timeout timespan (15 to 120 seconds), which gets stored in the Arduinos EEPROM.
Also, the trigger threshold can be monitored and sampled via the menu interface. Usually, the default values ought to be be in the range of +-50 Gauss. Any value below or above this threshold is being considered as "loaded".

# Recent changes

+ **2022-08-06** replaced the Full buffer of the OLED display with Page buffers because the Arduino runs into low memory issues. Refresh of the display will be slower now.
+ added some output to the serial port while the device is initializing (for debug purposes)
